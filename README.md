# WorkTrackerAIAssistant
A project to keep my works in line

So, I want to update my duties and work each day.
More importantly, keep track of my work of the day so I would know whether I had a productive day.

Ofc I have tried apps or website like notions to help me before,
but those are not efficient for me and I didn't want to waste a lot of time to plan stuff and record stuff and arrange my calender (which I found really irritaing).

So this WorkTrackerAssistant would be custom-made for my wills and habbits.

It doesen't have an official name yet, let's call it Elfie for now!
